  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Death penalty should be abolished\". I am going to make two arguments. First, misjudgment in the death penalty is very dangerous. Second, the death penalty is a cruel penalty. Let me start with the first argument. Humans make mistakes. This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It's very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely \"No\". Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It's much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that there isn't enough time to prove innocence when someone is on death row, so capital punishment should be ended. However, in the real world, executions are hardly carried out swiftly. It often takes years from the time someone is charged with a capital offense until they are tried and convicted. During that time, the defendant and his lawyer have ample opportunity to gather evidence and formulate a defense. Furthermore, once a death sentence is handed down, the prisoner is still facing an average of a decade or so before his actual execution date. These years spent on death row provide a chance to make multiple appeals and exhaust all the legal avenues to correct a wrongful execution. Thus, if evidence of innocence exists, a shortage of time is not a barrier to overturning a death sentence.",
