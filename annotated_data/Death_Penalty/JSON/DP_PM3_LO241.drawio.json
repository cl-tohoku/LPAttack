  "PM": "Hello, everyone. Today's topic is \"Death penalty should be abolished\". We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is \"Executioner's suffering\". The second point is \"Cruelty of death penalty\". I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher's room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don't know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers' stress is extremely overwhelming. That's why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that executioners feel responsible for killing, so the death penalty should be abolished. However, this issue isn't with the death penalty as a form of punishment, but with the effect on the executioner. So, that is what we should focus on solving. In some ways, it's hard to understand why an executioner should feel responsible, when they are merely carrying out orders. However, we can take steps to help remove the burden of guilt and responsibility nonetheless. For instance, like the example cited above where multiple prison officers push a button, we could have every person on duty line up to press a button -- from the prison warden down to the cafeteria workers. By increasing the pool of participants, no one would think they were the one that dealt the fatal punishment, and we could keep the death penalty on the books for the worst offenses.",
