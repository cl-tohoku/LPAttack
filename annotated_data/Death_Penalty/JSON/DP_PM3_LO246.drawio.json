  "PM": "Hello, everyone. Today's topic is \"Death penalty should be abolished\". We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is \"Executioner's suffering\". The second point is \"Cruelty of death penalty\". I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher's room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don't know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers' stress is extremely overwhelming. That's why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that prison guards who take part in executions suffer, so the death penalty needs to be abolished. However, why do we need prison guards to carry out executions? If their suffering is the issue, then why not make this a volunteer position? In addition to crime victims and their loved ones, there are probably a lot of people who would feel no guilt about serving as executioner in a case where the accused committed a horrific crime and was found guilty by his peers. In fact, a lottery might have to be held to award the executioner role, due to the vast number of applicants for the task. Maybe it would be better to let ordinary citizens instead of prison workers do this job anyway, in the same way we let ordinary citizens sit on the juries that decide the fate of prisoners, including life or death sentences.",
