  "PM": "Hello, everyone. Today's topic is \"Death penalty should be abolished\". We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is \"Executioner's suffering\". The second point is \"Cruelty of death penalty\". I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher's room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don't know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers' stress is extremely overwhelming. That's why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that executioners suffer tremendous amounts of stress as a result of carrying out death penalties on criminals, so therefore the death penalty should be done away with. However, I submit that any stress experienced by executioners is secondary compared to the range of devastating emotions experienced by the families who lose innocent loved ones at the hands of a criminal. I suspect that a majority of these victims' families ultimately want justice, and for these most heinous of crimes, the death penalty serves to offer them a sense of closure and enables them to begin the slow, long process of healing. Executioners who have concerns over their duty should receive more training, counseling, and communication from the victims' families assuring them that the greater good is being served by carrying out death penalties. That is, executioners are providing a much-needed service which provides real emotional benefits, and this is something that needs to be emphasized to ensure that the families of victims have a chance of having peace of mind.",
