  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Death penalty should be abolished\". I am going to make two arguments. First, misjudgment in the death penalty is very dangerous. Second, the death penalty is a cruel penalty. Let me start with the first argument. Humans make mistakes. This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It's very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely \"No\". Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It's much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that the death penalty doesn't make society safer because innocent people can be killed. However, this argument ignores the many ways that the death penalty protects society from harm. By permanently removing the most dangerous criminals from society, the death penalty serves as a safeguard against the loss of future lives. Furthermore, by serving to deter others from committing crimes that carry a death sentence, including mass murder and terrorism, the death penalty prevents additional casualties. Executions also protect fellow inmates and prison workers from the threat of death or injury at the hands of a violent criminal given a sentence other than capital punishment. So, when you balance the tiny number of truly innocent people who are executed against the many future lives that can be spared by retaining the death penalty, it's clear that this sentence keeps society safer.",
