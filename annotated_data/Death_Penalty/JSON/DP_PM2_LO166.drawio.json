  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Death penalty should be abolished\". I am going to make two arguments. First, misjudgment in the death penalty is very dangerous. Second, the death penalty is a cruel penalty. Let me start with the first argument. Humans make mistakes. This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It's very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely \"No\". Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It's much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that the death penalty should be abolished because it is terrible. However, the death penalty can bring closure to families in ways that having someone in prison for life does not bring. Taking away the death penalty takes away closure from grieving families. The act that someone carried out on this family's loved one is terrible and the chance that it happened is much higher than the chance that a mistake was made. With the technology that exists the chance that there was a mistake is very low.",
