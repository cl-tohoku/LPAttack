  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Death penalty should be abolished\". I am going to make two arguments. First, misjudgment in the death penalty is very dangerous. Second, the death penalty is a cruel penalty. Let me start with the first argument. Humans make mistakes. This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It's very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely \"No\". Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It's much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that the chance that an innocent person will be executed is a good reason to ban the death penalty. However, the death penalty is an imperfect form of justice, but it's not true that innocent people fill death row. Those who have been condemned to die represent criminals guilty of the most horrific crimes. They have been represented in court and found guilty by a unanimous jury of their peers, who have taken an oath to render a verdict based on the evidence. An appeals court system exists to give those sentenced to death another opportunity to correct mistakes in their first trial, present new evidence, and raise issues related to prosecutorial misconduct, jury tampering, and the like. Typically, it takes years for appeals to be exhausted, as cases are scrutinized to ensure no innocent person is sent to his death.",
