  "PM": "Hello, everyone. Today's topic is \"Death penalty should be abolished\". We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is \"Executioner's suffering\". The second point is \"Cruelty of death penalty\". I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher's room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don't know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers' stress is extremely overwhelming. That's why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that executioners suffer, so we should get rid of the death penalty. However, while it can't be denied that taking part in an execution involves suffering, there are ways to make the situation less painful for all involved. One way to help reduce executioner guilt and suffering is to make sure they understand that the punishment is just. We can do that by ensuring that only those truly guilty of the worst crimes get this sentence, that it is meted out fairly instead of only to the poor and to minorities, and that it is delivered in the most humane fashion. We can also have executioners meet with victims and their loved ones, in order to learn how they can help these wronged parties get justice and closure. These steps can reduce executioner suffering while retaining an effective form of punishment.",
