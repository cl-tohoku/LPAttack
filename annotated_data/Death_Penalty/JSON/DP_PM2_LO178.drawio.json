  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Death penalty should be abolished\". I am going to make two arguments. First, misjudgment in the death penalty is very dangerous. Second, the death penalty is a cruel penalty. Let me start with the first argument. Humans make mistakes. This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It's very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely \"No\". Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It's much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that because there is a chance of a mistake in a death penalty case, we must end capital punishment. However, this argument is a case of throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Just because a tiny fraction of those executed may have been innocent doesn't mean the death penalty doesn't have more benefits than disadvantages. Instead of getting rid of the death penalty, we should be focused on eliminating the chance of error resulting in the execution of the truly innocent. One way this is already occurring is by increasingly relying on the strongest, most foolproof evidence: DNA left at the scene. Furthermore, video captured by security cameras is replacing eyewitness testimony, which has a greater chance of inaccuracy due to imperfect human memory. Another way mistakes can be reduced is by increasing use of all the legal avenues of redress, including the appeals process. Error reduction should be the focus rather than elimination of a penalty that protects society.",
