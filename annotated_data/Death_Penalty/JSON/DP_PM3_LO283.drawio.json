  "PM": "Hello, everyone. Today's topic is \"Death penalty should be abolished\". We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is \"Executioner's suffering\". The second point is \"Cruelty of death penalty\". I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher's room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don't know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers' stress is extremely overwhelming. That's why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that executioners suffer, so the death penalty needs to be abolished. However, the suffering of executioners only bears testament to the gravity of the job and the importance of seeing that justice is served. If executing people was easy, something would be terribly wrong. Those who are part of the criminal justice system understand the purpose of capital punishment and consider it their duty to perform their job, even if it means taking part in an execution. It is only right and natural for anyone taking part in an execution to feel bad, in some way, just as it is natural for soldiers on the battlefield to feel bad about killing, even when the enemy has done terrible things. However, this doesn't justify removing the option of capital punishment, any more than the suffering of soldiers justifies removing the option of fighting a battle to defend your country.",
