  "PM": "Hello, everyone. Today's topic is \"Death penalty should be abolished\". We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is \"Executioner's suffering\". The second point is \"Cruelty of death penalty\". I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher's room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don't know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers' stress is extremely overwhelming. That's why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that because executioners feel bad about the job, we should abolish the death penalty. However, instead of doing away with capital punishment since executioners might suffer from taking part, why not train them so they are prepared? Lots of people deal with unpleasant and even traumatic things on the job, but their jobs are too vital to eliminate altogether. The way we handle this is by making sure the candidates for the job are both physically and psychologically up to the task, whether the job involves tending to traffic accident victims or carrying out the final step in a death sentence case. Would-be executioners can be prepared, and avoid PTSD, if they are given proper training beforehand and, just as importantly, proper counseling afterward.",
