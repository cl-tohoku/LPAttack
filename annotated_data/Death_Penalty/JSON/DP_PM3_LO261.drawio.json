  "PM": "Hello, everyone. Today's topic is \"Death penalty should be abolished\". We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is \"Executioner's suffering\". The second point is \"Cruelty of death penalty\". I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher's room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don't know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers' stress is extremely overwhelming. That's why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that executing an inmate causes executioners to suffer, so we must abolish the death penalty. However, in death penalty cases, there is always going to be suffering, but the executioner's pain is nothing compared to the victim's. In addition, the executioner's suffering can be minimized, but the victim's often cannot. One way to help executioner's reduce their sense of stress and pain over partaking in this punishment is to understand the power of delivering justice and closure to the victim and their loved ones. Before the execution date, the would-be executioner should meet with the survivors of the crime, to understand their pain and what relief they will achieve from the execution. By sharing and empathizing with the victims, the executioner's own suffering will be lessened and a sense of peach can be achieved by all.",
