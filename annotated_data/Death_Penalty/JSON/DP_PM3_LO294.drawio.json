  "PM": "Hello, everyone. Today's topic is \"Death penalty should be abolished\". We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is \"Executioner's suffering\". The second point is \"Cruelty of death penalty\". I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher's room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don't know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers' stress is extremely overwhelming. That's why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that the death penalty is harmful to the people that do the deed of pulling the switch or in the case of the stated argument the persons pushing the button that hangs the condemned man. However, there are now sophisticated computers that can take the place of the executioner therefore relieving the stress of being the person that actually pushes the button or pulls the lever. The computer can be programed from a different location for the time the execution is taking place. The person who programs the computer need not know the reason for the program and never feels the stress of killing another human being. The disassociation to the deed will then not cause the executioner any stress or guilt feelings. Computers have no feelings and only do what they are programmed to do. No human ever need to feel the stress of killing another human.",
