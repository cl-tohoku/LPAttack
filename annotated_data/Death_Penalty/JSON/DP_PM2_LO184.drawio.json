  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Death penalty should be abolished\". I am going to make two arguments. First, misjudgment in the death penalty is very dangerous. Second, the death penalty is a cruel penalty. Let me start with the first argument. Humans make mistakes. This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It's very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely \"No\". Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It's much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that society is safer when the death penalty is abolished because it risks loss of innocent lives. However, you have to consider the deterrent effect of the death penalty when deciding whether abolishing it actually leads to fewer innocent lives lost. In addition to future innocent lives that can be taken by a criminal who is given a sentence other than death, we must remember the countless innocent lives that are potentially saved because the death penalty remains an option in the criminal justice system. Because the threat of death by execution keeps even a small percent of would-be murderers from killing, capital punishment helps protect society. Removing the death penalty sends a message that innocent lives are not valuable enough to warrant this most effective safeguard.",
