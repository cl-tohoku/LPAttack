  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". I am going to make two arguments: First, forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character, rather than active. Secondly, abolishing assignments can reduce teachers' workloads. Let me start with the first argument. Some people may think that students should be given homework so that they can learn what to do. However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a \"teacher\" who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves. In order to avoid this, homework should be abolished so that students can study on their own initiative. Therefore, for these reasons, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character. However, yes it might be true somehow. But it is not mutually exclusive in this debate. Even if there are no assignments forced by teacher, children are forced many passive choices. For example, student parents say that \"You should study harder than now , so you must go to cram school.\" or \"you should play piano because it might be helpful for your future.\". These kind of parental oppression of child decision exit in their paradigm rather it will be stronger because parent need to instruct their child instead of the teacher. That's why I believe government side point is not mutually exclusive.",
