  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that homework should be abolished. We defined that homework for primary students should be abolished. We have two points: First, some students tend to dislike studying. Secondly, we have more effective learning ways than homework. Let me explain our first argument. Some students tend to dislike studying but are obliged to do homework and most of students are not enthusiastic about homework. Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies. They are always looking around, crawling from corner to corner, and touching, even biting, everything unfamiliar to them. In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That's how studying should be. It's not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents. Being obliged will lead to problems between family. That's one of the reasons some students tend to dislike studying. That is why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that being obliged will lead to problems between family. That's one of the reasons some students tend to dislike studying, so homework should be abolished. However, not all families have these troubles and these troubles are caused by the way of parents to attend children is not good, not by existence of homework. Rather, depending on parents' caring, children may carry out homework without stresses. The opinion that troubles happen between students and parents, and teachers because of homework ignores the way to supply homework. We can change the way to present homework and it can change students' enthusiasms. Therefore, the government opinion of abolishing homework is rejected.",
