  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". We have two points: The first point is \"free time\" and the second point is \"decrease burden on teachers\". I will explain the first point of \"free time\". We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don't have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that homework is damaging students' health. However, such excessive homework, which is likely to damage the health of children is so unrealistic. This is because school has strong incentive to protect their students' health. The main source of that incentive is possibility of backlash from parents of them. If they imposed excessive amount of homework, and some children's health were endangered, teachers would be criticized from their parents. In addition this, such parents are able to speak out that through social media in 21 century. So that criticism might be done by whole society. That's to say, such excessive amount of homework is too risky for them to impose. Hence we say that is so unrealistic characterization.",
