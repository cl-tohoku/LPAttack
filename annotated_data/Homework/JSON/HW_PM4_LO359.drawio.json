  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that homework should be abolished. We strongly support this motion. Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to talk about homework in every school in Japan. We have two points in our argument. The first point is \"harmful efforts\" and the second point is \"decreasing teacher's burden\". Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I'll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study. For all these reasons, we strongly support the motion. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that homework should be abolished. However, how will abolishing homework lead to students understanding the right way to study? That seems like it's wishful thinking. Homework is a form of studying. One that you truly don't have a choice to do if you care about your grade. If students are already blowing it off because they don't give themselves enough time, what makes you think they'll study on their own? It's hard to imagine that a student who didn't have time to complete a required assignment is going to open a book on their own to study. In the end, this will not lead to improved studying skills. It's going to lead to a lack of it. I turn you have more unprepared students who aren't ready for tests and quizzes administered by teachers or the ones that the state is in charge of.",
