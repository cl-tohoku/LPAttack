  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". We have two points: The first point is \"free time\" and the second point is \"decrease burden on teachers\". I will explain the first point of \"free time\". We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don't have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that there is no room in the student's schedule for homework. However, fitting activities into a frequently busy schedule is a life skill that homework helps teach and that proves useful beyond school. Learning how to make a schedule is a worthy lesson, and it is just one of the benefits of assigning homework. When a student gets a homework assignment, he has a few choices: create a schedule with a time slot for doing the homework, hope he remembers to do the work without creating a schedule, or ignore the assignment in favor of another way to spend time after class. When the latter methods fail and negative consequences (like a failing grade) result, the student eventually learns that the way to succeed is by making time for important tasks, and the best tool for doing that is a schedule.",
