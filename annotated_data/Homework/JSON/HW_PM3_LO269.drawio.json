  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that homework should be abolished. We defined that homework for primary students should be abolished. We have two points: First, some students tend to dislike studying. Secondly, we have more effective learning ways than homework. Let me explain our first argument. Some students tend to dislike studying but are obliged to do homework and most of students are not enthusiastic about homework. Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies. They are always looking around, crawling from corner to corner, and touching, even biting, everything unfamiliar to them. In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That's how studying should be. It's not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents. Being obliged will lead to problems between family. That's one of the reasons some students tend to dislike studying. That is why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that students shouldn't be obliged to study, so homework should be abolished. However, facing up to responsibilities is an essential life skill. Fulfilling the obligation of completing homework assignments is one way kids practice and eventually acquire that skill. Being obliged to do something is hardly limited to homework, and we don't abolish all those other obligations. For instance, we're obliged to pay taxes, to feed our pets, and to brush our teeth. Abolishing those obligations would be disastrous for the nation, for the well-being of our pets, and for the health of our teeth! Likewise, abolishing the obligation to do homework would have negative effects. Not only would students miss out on learning opportunities, they would fail to develop a vital life skill, one that helps define what it means to be a responsible, contributing member of society",
