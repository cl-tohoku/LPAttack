  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that homework should be abolished. We strongly support this motion. Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to talk about homework in every school in Japan. We have two points in our argument. The first point is \"harmful efforts\" and the second point is \"decreasing teacher's burden\". Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I'll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study. For all these reasons, we strongly support the motion. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that students who copy homework work get passing scores without understanding how to study properly. However, you could apply this same logic to test taking: students who copy test answers from their neighbor can pass a test without understanding the material. But not many people would argue that this is a valid reason to do away with testing. In fact, you could argue that this is a good teaching opportunity for learning about ethics and the consequences of one's choices. Students who copy answers on tests and homework run the risk of copying bad work as well as the risk of getting caught and facing repercussions like failure or expulsion. Students also learn, over time, that copying work is counter to actually studying and learning the material. Abolishing testing or homework deprives students of the chance to learn this.",
