  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". We have two points: The first point is \"free time\" and the second point is \"decrease burden on teachers\". I will explain the first point of \"free time\". We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don't have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that consuming the time fir club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends is so important that we should abolish homework. However, it's not so important point compared to studying time of them, which hugely affects their future. In the first place, we think the most realistic feature of children is laziness. If they have free time, they are likely to play with their friends, play video game, and watching YouTube. Those entertainments are made to attract many people. However studying is not made to entertain them. In that instance, we have to recognize that they are likely to consume their time meaninglessly. Outcomes by seeing YouTube, playing video game, and hanging out are less likely to contribute their future. On the other hand, Studying is useful for their future basically. For example, if they have high academic skill, they would be able to get college degree, which is important for job hunting. So we say their benefit that they can get more free time is less important compared to the risk.",
