  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". I am going to make two arguments: First, forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character, rather than active. Secondly, abolishing assignments can reduce teachers' workloads. Let me start with the first argument. Some people may think that students should be given homework so that they can learn what to do. However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a \"teacher\" who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves. In order to avoid this, homework should be abolished so that students can study on their own initiative. Therefore, for these reasons, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character. However, I believe that homework should not be abolished from schools. I believe that if the homework is assigned correctly and the student understands how to complete it well it will not make the student passive. Rather, it will encourage the student to find and use outside resources in order to enlarge their educational sphere. If the student doesn't know how to do something or how to answer a question the student will have to find appropriate resources to find out how and the student will additionally have to understand how to use those resources. This is something that employers generally do like because it shows that the worker knows how to be independent and work on their own rather than relying on their supervisor for assistance as soon as any sort of challenge arises.",
