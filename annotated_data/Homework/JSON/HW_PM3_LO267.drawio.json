  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that homework should be abolished. We defined that homework for primary students should be abolished. We have two points: First, some students tend to dislike studying. Secondly, we have more effective learning ways than homework. Let me explain our first argument. Some students tend to dislike studying but are obliged to do homework and most of students are not enthusiastic about homework. Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies. They are always looking around, crawling from corner to corner, and touching, even biting, everything unfamiliar to them. In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That's how studying should be. It's not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents. Being obliged will lead to problems between family. That's one of the reasons some students tend to dislike studying. That is why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that studying should be like exploration to a baby, not obligatory like homework. However, there is no reason homework can't be just as stimulating as an unfamiliar environment is to a baby. In fact, the kind of homework that lets students explore what interests them and explore beyond the confines of the classroom and its lessons is the best kind of homework. This is what homework is ideally suited for, because it is not limited to the classroom and its rigid schedule, tied to the clock. Homework can stimulate students' minds in the way classroom lessons often do not, because students are free to think beyond what is written on a chalkboard or printed in a textbook. Homework can even encourage students to go outside, get on the ground like a toddler again, and look at the world in a new way.",
