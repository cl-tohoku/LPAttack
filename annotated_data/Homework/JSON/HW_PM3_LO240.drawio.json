  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that homework should be abolished. We defined that homework for primary students should be abolished. We have two points: First, some students tend to dislike studying. Secondly, we have more effective learning ways than homework. Let me explain our first argument. Some students tend to dislike studying but are obliged to do homework and most of students are not enthusiastic about homework. Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies. They are always looking around, crawling from corner to corner, and touching, even biting, everything unfamiliar to them. In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That's how studying should be. It's not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents. Being obliged will lead to problems between family. That's one of the reasons some students tend to dislike studying. That is why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that homework is not satisfying intellectual curiosity. However, it is not true because students may notice intellectual curiosity thanks to homework. As prime minister said in their speech, students more or less dislike studying. However, in current situation, homework is put on every day. Thus, students are imposed to study. On the process of that, students may find some curious points. On that occasion, they have opportunity to study by themselves. Therefore, their assumption is not true, then homework should not be abolished.",
