  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". I am going to make two arguments: First, forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character, rather than active. Secondly, abolishing assignments can reduce teachers' workloads. Let me start with the first argument. Some people may think that students should be given homework so that they can learn what to do. However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a \"teacher\" who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves. In order to avoid this, homework should be abolished so that students can study on their own initiative. Therefore, for these reasons, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that studying on student's initiative is beneficial for their future. However, we believe that that is less likely to be beneficial for their future. This is because such studying is not done based on deep consideration. In the first place, it is difficult for them to consider future benefit for them. They don't have enough experience to do that. For example, they don't have experience to go to university. They don't have experience to study engineering, high level science usually. We say that they might be able to feel happiness from studying those fields. However if students study based on their initiative, they might give up studying them and happiness without knowing that. We believe that homework, which can coerce them into studying can let them find out their own potential interest and happiness. Abolishing them is harmful, rather than beneficial for their future happiness.",
