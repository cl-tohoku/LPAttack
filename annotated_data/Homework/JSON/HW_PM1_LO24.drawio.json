  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". We have two points: The first point is \"free time\" and the second point is \"decrease burden on teachers\". I will explain the first point of \"free time\". We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don't have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that we can enjoy free time on their side. . However, it's not mutually exclusive. That's because we can still enjoy club activity or hobby even if we have to reduce time taken to do so. For example, in their case, they can still enjoy playing tennis even if they reduce 30 minutes to play tennis to sleep 30 longer. As long as they have never explained what is the exclusive difference between having free time and more free time, we can say enjoying free time is still possible on our side.",
