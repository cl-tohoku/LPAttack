  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". I am going to make two arguments: First, forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character, rather than active. Secondly, abolishing assignments can reduce teachers' workloads. Let me start with the first argument. Some people may think that students should be given homework so that they can learn what to do. However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a \"teacher\" who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves. In order to avoid this, homework should be abolished so that students can study on their own initiative. Therefore, for these reasons, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that homework are given so that students can learn what to do. However, it's quite doubtful. Homework tells us what to study, but its essence is reviewing. We should not abolish homework unless this reviewing can be guaranteed in the government paradigm. The role of education is to bring up an independent student who can successfully participate in society. Thorough homework, we can review what we learned in the class and get a deep understanding, which is essential to start a good career. It will be required in the entrance exam of the university, an employment exam, and so on. We should have the right understanding of why homework is needed today.",
