  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". I am going to make two arguments: First, forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character, rather than active. Secondly, abolishing assignments can reduce teachers' workloads. Let me start with the first argument. Some people may think that students should be given homework so that they can learn what to do. However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a \"teacher\" who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves. In order to avoid this, homework should be abolished so that students can study on their own initiative. Therefore, for these reasons, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that homework develops passive attitude toward learning, studying when students are at school and even their works, careers, lives throughout their entire life. Therefore, homework should be abolished. However, the essence of homework is about the process. Students should be get more involved in homework. Start from the very beginning of homework, teachers should encourage students to participate the creation of homework and accommodate students' ideas and thoughts to create interesting homework together. Teachers' role in homework is to observe and encourage students whereas students are empowered to take initiates throughout every aspect of the homework process to deliver the results of learning. Teachers encourage students to brainstorm ideas, ask questions for clarification, and overcome difficulties. The process can be far outweighed the results, which develop proactive and independent growth mind-set that can be one of the biggest assets in their life. Therefore, homework should not be abolished.",
