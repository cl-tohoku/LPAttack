  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". I am going to make two arguments: First, forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character, rather than active. Secondly, abolishing assignments can reduce teachers' workloads. Let me start with the first argument. Some people may think that students should be given homework so that they can learn what to do. However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a \"teacher\" who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves. In order to avoid this, homework should be abolished so that students can study on their own initiative. Therefore, for these reasons, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that homework is not good preparation for the real world. However, homework can actually serve as a good transition between school and life after school. In a real sense, homework straddles these two worlds by literally taking place after school, in preparation for what comes after graduation. Homework resembles and prepares students for the real world, where an authority figure like a teacher is typically not directly present -- in sight, and within easy reach. Nonetheless, that authority figure is still a force to be reckoned with for students, since failing to complete the assignment has repercussions like a failing grade. This is much like the real world, where the worker must have the initiative to do their work or suffer termination or demotion, even without a boss hovering over them.",
