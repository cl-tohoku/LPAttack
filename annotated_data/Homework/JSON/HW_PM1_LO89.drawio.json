  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". We have two points: The first point is \"free time\" and the second point is \"decrease burden on teachers\". I will explain the first point of \"free time\". We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don't have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that homework doesn't fit into the student's busy schedule. However, in life, it is important to learn how to prioritize activities. Having a busy schedule is a fact of life for students, and being too busy to fit in every possible activity is something that continues into adulthood. That's why it's so important to figure out how to decide which activities matter most and deserve priority over less meaningful activities. It's pretty easy to see that homework is more important than playing video games or hanging out with friends at the mall, for instance, since homework is part of education. Thus, the student should put \"doing my homework\" at or near the top of the list when deciding how to allocate limited time.",
