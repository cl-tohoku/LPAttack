  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". We have two points: The first point is \"free time\" and the second point is \"decrease burden on teachers\". I will explain the first point of \"free time\". We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don't have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that abolishing homework is beneficial because students will be able to do what they want. However, it's not important. Playing with friends or do other things what they want is ok, it's fun for them. However it's fun for them doesn't mean we should abolish homework. Students are not matured enough that they can calculate what is really beneficial for them in the future. They seek the happiness which is in-front of them. Teacher gave us homework so that students can have better understanding of the class and it's not super hard because all the students are required to do. To acquire the basic knowledge is not necessarily fun, but it'll be required afterward. Good example is entrance exam. Without the basic knowledge our opportunity will be limited sadly.",
