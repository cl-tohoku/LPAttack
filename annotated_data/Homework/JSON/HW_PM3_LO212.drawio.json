  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that homework should be abolished. We defined that homework for primary students should be abolished. We have two points: First, some students tend to dislike studying. Secondly, we have more effective learning ways than homework. Let me explain our first argument. Some students tend to dislike studying but are obliged to do homework and most of students are not enthusiastic about homework. Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies. They are always looking around, crawling from corner to corner, and touching, even biting, everything unfamiliar to them. In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That's how studying should be. It's not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents. Being obliged will lead to problems between family. That's one of the reasons some students tend to dislike studying. That is why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that students should study based on their curiosity. However, it is not a important point in this debate. This is because they can study based on their curiosity even if they have some homework. For example, they can go to museums after finishing their homework during summer vacation. They can study their favorite subjects after finishing their homework. That's to say, they have some free time to study based on their curiosity even if they have some homework. That's the reason why we believe that even if studying based on curiosity is important thing, students can do that even without abolishing homework.",
