  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that homework should be abolished. We defined that homework for primary students should be abolished. We have two points: First, some students tend to dislike studying. Secondly, we have more effective learning ways than homework. Let me explain our first argument. Some students tend to dislike studying but are obliged to do homework and most of students are not enthusiastic about homework. Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies. They are always looking around, crawling from corner to corner, and touching, even biting, everything unfamiliar to them. In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That's how studying should be. It's not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents. Being obliged will lead to problems between family. That's one of the reasons some students tend to dislike studying. That is why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that young students tend to dislike studying, so homework should be abolished. However, the decision whether school should be abolished or not should be evaluated not by preference of students, but by needs and importance. One of the most important functions of elementary school is to make students acquire minimum knowledge for survival like four arithmetic calculations, mother language, and so on. If students do not learn these fundamental themes for the reason of dislike, students cannot get abilities to live in the societies. Primary schools must not permit that situation as compulsory education.",
