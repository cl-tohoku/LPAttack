  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". We have two points: The first point is \"free time\" and the second point is \"decrease burden on teachers\". I will explain the first point of \"free time\". We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don't have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. In other words, we can not do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends because of a lot of homework. However, i think that we have enough time for doing more of what we really like. We can play with friends and devote oneself to club activities and hobbies on weekend like Saturday and Sunday. If we don't have enough time on weekend, we should consider our ways to spend time. In this case, we don't have enough time on weekday. So, we have to consider our ways to spend time more effectively.",
