  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". We have two points: The first point is \"free time\" and the second point is \"decrease burden on teachers\". I will explain the first point of \"free time\". We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don't have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that present situation are lack of free time for students and students cannot do what really they want, so homework should be abolished. However, not all students are lack of time in present situation. For example, I belonged to Judo club in junior high and high school and I could join extracurricular activity that I wanted to join in, but I could implement homework and I could guarantee enough time for sleeping. Even if homework is accumulated, some people can control the tasks. It is also training to manage having time in school. Therefore, lack of time is not necessarily caused by a lot of homework, but lack of management skills, therefore, the government opinion is rejected.",
