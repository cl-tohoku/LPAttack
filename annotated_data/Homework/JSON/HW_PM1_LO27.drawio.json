  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". We have two points: The first point is \"free time\" and the second point is \"decrease burden on teachers\". I will explain the first point of \"free time\". We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don't have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that by abolishing homework, we can enjoy more free time. However, it's not important.Even if having free time and doing homework is the trade off, we should prioritize doing homework now. Because homework can establish the basic foundation of studying because homework is a good guideline of what we should review and study. Given studying is based on the accumulation of understanding, once we get behind, catching up classes is difficult. But, even without more free time, we can enjoy interaction with friends at school. That's why doing homework is more important than having more free time.",
