  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". I am going to make two arguments: First, forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character, rather than active. Secondly, abolishing assignments can reduce teachers' workloads. Let me start with the first argument. Some people may think that students should be given homework so that they can learn what to do. However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a \"teacher\" who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves. In order to avoid this, homework should be abolished so that students can study on their own initiative. Therefore, for these reasons, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that school is a place to learn how to live. However, given that, we can say that doing homework is also necessary to cultivate the ability to live in society. Because in the future, students will have to fulfill what is required. For example, in the corporation, students will have to do some tasks or projects assigned by their boss. That's why experience of following what others tell you to do.It's also necessary ability after students advance into society.",
