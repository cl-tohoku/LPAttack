  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". We have two points: The first point is \"free time\" and the second point is \"decrease burden on teachers\". I will explain the first point of \"free time\". We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don't have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "\"They said that in order to get more free time and reduce the pressure of teachers, homework should be abolished. However, I don't think so, because homework is a kind of review and feedback for students who have learned knowledge on the same day, to deepen their impression of knowledge, students can enter their ideal university and learn knowledge is inseparable, but there are many students in many countries in the world whose homework is beyond their scope, they don't have time to participate other activities. So I don't think homework should be abolished, but we can reduce the amount of homework properly and let students have more free time so that the burden of teachers can also be reduced.\"",
