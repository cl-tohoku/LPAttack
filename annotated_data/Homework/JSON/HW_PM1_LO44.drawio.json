  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". We have two points: The first point is \"free time\" and the second point is \"decrease burden on teachers\". I will explain the first point of \"free time\". We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don't have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that homework should be abolish because it takes so much time and it deprive our sleeping time. However, there was no explanation that why we need to abolish \"homework\". According to an explanation from PM, PM goes to clam school and tennis club every day. Why should we abolish homework? Why not tennis club or clam school? They should explain why these activities should be prioritized over homework. Homework is made by teacher who is professional in teaching. The contents and level are well considered and it helps the understanding of class in school. We should prioritize homework over other activities.",
