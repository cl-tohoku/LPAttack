This repository consists the corpus (logic patterns of attacks of 250 debates) annotated by the LPAttack scheme and the annotation guidelines.

## Corpus
We utilized the debates from the TYPIC dataset (Naito et al. 2022) for LPAttack annotation. Each debate consists an Initial argument, referred to as "PM Speech" (speech from Prime Minister) and a Counterargument, referred to as "LO Speech" (speech from Leader of Opposition). The debates are wriiten for 2 topics: `Death penalty should be abolished` and `Homework should be abolished`. 

In each of the topic folder, the `JSON` folder consists the data the `DRAWIO` folder consists the visual diagrams for the data (can be opened and seen using https://www.diagrams.net/).
