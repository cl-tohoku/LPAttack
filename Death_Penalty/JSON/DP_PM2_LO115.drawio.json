  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Death penalty should be abolished\". I am going to make two arguments. First, misjudgment in the death penalty is very dangerous. Second, the death penalty is a cruel penalty. Let me start with the first argument. Humans make mistakes. This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It's very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely \"No\". Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It's much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that we need to abolish the death penalty because there's always a chance one of the people put to death could be innocent. However, it is extremely rare for such a thing to happen. At this day in age, police work, science, and technology are so good that the chance of someone getting mistakenly killed is so low that when it does happen, it makes national headlines. I can't even think of the last time I heard of an innocent being killed on death row. And just because there is a chance of this happening, doesn't mean we should do away with it all together. There's also a chance of innocents going to jail for small things like stealing, but we aren't going to abolish jail all together. The truth is, nothing is ever going to be 100 percent perfect and we can't do away with stuff because of the small chance of something bad happening.",
