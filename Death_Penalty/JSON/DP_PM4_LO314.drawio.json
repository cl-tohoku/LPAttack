  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that the death penalty should be abolished. We strongly support this motion. Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to abolish the death penalty all over the world and introduce a life-imprisonment system. It means that criminals stay in jail forever. We have two points. First point is \"Rehabilitation\". The second point is \"World's trend\". So, let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that the death penalty deprives the chance of rehabilitation of the criminals. Our reasoning is as follows. In the case of a serious crime such as murder, especially random killing of many people, a heavy punishment should be sentenced. The death penalty might be an option, but it just ends the life of a criminal and solves nothing. The criminal has no chance to reflect on what they have done. They need to reflect on their wrong-doing every day. They should spend their lives reflecting on it. Life imprisonment system is, in a sense, a very severe punishment. Criminals are restricted of their freedom all day. They need to continue to apologize for the rest of their life while thinking about their victims. Moreover, there is a perspective that the society creates the criminals. For example, imagine a case that a student who was always been bullied and notified others such as teachers and the community, but they did nothing to help. The student was ignored by everyone. In that case, it is understandable that the student attacks others due to their anger at a society where no one helps. Like this, a society also has a responsibility for a criminal, and for this reason, it is a government task to set the opportunity of rehabilitation in the life imprisonment system. The death penalty is an irresponsible act by the nation. For all these reasons, we beg to propose. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that the death penalty removes any chance of rehabilitation of the criminal, merely ending the life of the perpetrator and offering no chance for reflection, remorse, or most importantly, redemption. However, society needs to be able to send a message that certain behaviors are beyond redemption. There are some specific acts\u2014a category of crime, if you will\u2014that are so heinous, so reprehensible, and so outside the confines of any semblance of civilization, that the only response from a sane public is to eliminate the person(s) responsible. Situations like Sandy Hook, like Columbine, like 9/11 are operating on a level of criminality that is above and beyond any hope or possibility of forgiveness. There is no \"coming back\" from horrors such as these. There is no \"moving on\" after visiting such atrocities on the world. For that reason, death is the only viable solution. Criminals such as these are akin to cancerous growths that must be removed in order for the world to function; the message must be sent that their worst actions will be met with our most extreme response: death.",
