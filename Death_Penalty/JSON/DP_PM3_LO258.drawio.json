  "PM": "Hello, everyone. Today's topic is \"Death penalty should be abolished\". We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is \"Executioner's suffering\". The second point is \"Cruelty of death penalty\". I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher's room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don't know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers' stress is extremely overwhelming. That's why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that the stress put on executioners means the death penalty should be abolished. However, if executioner stress is the issue, then the most direct answer is to find a way to lower that stress, rather than to get rid of a legal option for punishing criminals. There are actually a number of ways to minimize the stress of executions for those who take part in them. In addition to the example given, where none of the guards knows who pushes the 'kill' switch, executioners can rotate jobs, get extra counseling and days off, and get assurance that the death-row inmate has been made comfortable and will fill no pain. Moreover, if the executioner knows that the inmate himself is prepared to accept his death, then feelings of guilt can be reduced. These are better solutions than abolishing an effective deterrent.",
