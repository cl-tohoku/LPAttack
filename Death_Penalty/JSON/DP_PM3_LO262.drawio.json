  "PM": "Hello, everyone. Today's topic is \"Death penalty should be abolished\". We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is \"Executioner's suffering\". The second point is \"Cruelty of death penalty\". I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher's room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don't know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers' stress is extremely overwhelming. That's why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that the death penalty should be abolished because executioners feel that they are responsible themselves for the death of the inmate. However, instead of getting rid of capital punishment, we should deal directly with its impact on executioners. The argument given here against the death penalty actually provides evidence against its own claim, by citing the example of an execution set-up where no one who participates knows whether they were the actual executioner. You could even set up the execution so that each prison official simultaneously grasped the same large lever to deliver the lethal effect, or have each official enter in a single number or letter in a sequence that, together, would activate the process of execution. In this way, no single 'executioner' would feel they alone shouldered the burden of the inmate's death, and we could keep the death penalty as an option.",
