  "PM": "Hello, everyone. Today's topic is \"Death penalty should be abolished\". We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is \"Executioner's suffering\". The second point is \"Cruelty of death penalty\". I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher's room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don't know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers' stress is extremely overwhelming. That's why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that the death penalty is just too stressful for executions, so it should be abolished. However, working in a prison is stressful in itself, and the best candidate for any prison job is someone who can handle stress. On a daily basis, prison guards handle high-pressure situations, including prison rioting and inmate suicide attempts. Taking part in an execution is really just part of the job for these prison officers. Working day to day with prisoners, including the most hardened death row inmates, serves as preparation to deal with the stress of an execution. In some ways, an execution might even provide relief for the guard, if he has gotten to know the victim's family, for instance, or if he has helped the inmate make peace with himself in preparation for the ultimate punishment.",
