  "PM": "Hello, everyone. Today's topic is \"Death penalty should be abolished\". We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is \"Executioner's suffering\". The second point is \"Cruelty of death penalty\". I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher's room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don't know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers' stress is extremely overwhelming. That's why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that the death penalty should be abolished because the executioner suffers by carrying out his job. However, this argument isn't really logical, because being an executioner is a voluntary career choice. An executioner is not like a concentration camp guard ordered to open fire on innocent civilians. Instead, the executioner is part of the criminal justice system and holds a position that is a job choice. No one forces a person to apply for and accept a job that involves taking part in legal executions. This is the career path that the would-be executioner has chosen, and he is free to leave the job if his conscience cannot bear the idea of carrying out his job. This is as silly as arguing that hamburgers should be outlawed because butchers suffer due to their part in the beef industry.",
