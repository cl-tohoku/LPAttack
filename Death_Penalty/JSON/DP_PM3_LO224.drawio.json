  "PM": "Hello, everyone. Today's topic is \"Death penalty should be abolished\". We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is \"Executioner's suffering\". The second point is \"Cruelty of death penalty\". I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher's room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don't know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers' stress is extremely overwhelming. That's why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that the suffering of executioners is a reason to end the death penalty. However, this argument assumes that executioners do their job unwillingly. It assumes that no one would want to serve in the role of executioner because doing so causes great suffering, including feelings of guilt. On the contrary, it would probably be quite easy to find volunteers for the job, even unpaid ones. You could start by asking members of the victims families -- or the victims themselves, if they somehow survived. For these people, being able to take part in carrying out the death sentence might provide a great sense of justice and serve as some form of restitution, if not revenge, for the wrong done to them. So, claiming that executioners suffer too much is a poor argument.",
