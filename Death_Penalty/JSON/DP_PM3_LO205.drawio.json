  "PM": "Hello, everyone. Today's topic is \"Death penalty should be abolished\". We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. We have two points. The first point is \"Executioner's suffering\". The second point is \"Cruelty of death penalty\". I will explain the first point. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher's room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don't know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers' stress is extremely overwhelming. That's why the death penalty should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that we should abolish the death penalty since executioner's feel responsible for killing death row inmates by their own hands. However, there are several solutions to minimize the sense of responsibility felt by executioners, besides just throwing out the death penalty. For instance, advances in technology make it possible to automate much, if not all, of the execution process, so no one has to feel they have blood on their hands, so to speak. Other methods for eliminating the feeling of sole responsibility include using a firing squad where only one gun is loaded with a real bullet, for instance. Would-be executioners could even draw straws to see who would carry out the task, taking out any element of choice that might make them feel responsible. So, this doesn't stand up as an excuse to abolish capital punishment.",
