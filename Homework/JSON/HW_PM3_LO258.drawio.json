  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that homework should be abolished. We defined that homework for primary students should be abolished. We have two points: First, some students tend to dislike studying. Secondly, we have more effective learning ways than homework. Let me explain our first argument. Some students tend to dislike studying but are obliged to do homework and most of students are not enthusiastic about homework. Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies. They are always looking around, crawling from corner to corner, and touching, even biting, everything unfamiliar to them. In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That's how studying should be. It's not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents. Being obliged will lead to problems between family. That's one of the reasons some students tend to dislike studying. That is why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that having to oblige students to study is bad, so homework should be abolished. However, this argument assumes that students are obligated to complete homework or face some sort of negative consequence. In fact, homework assignments can include greater freedom to choose than in-classroom lessons. With homework, for instance, students have more liberty when it comes to choosing how, when and where to study; a student might choose to do homework while listening to his favorite music, while enjoying a favorite snack, or while sprawling on his bed. Having this freedom of choice inclines students to be less resistant to homework, not more resistant. Teachers can also give students freedom of choice by offering different homework topics or types; students might get to choose from making a scrapbook or interviewing a neighbor or writing a letter to the editor. In this way, homework is less about obligation and more about freedom.",
