  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". I am going to make two arguments: First, forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character, rather than active. Secondly, abolishing assignments can reduce teachers' workloads. Let me start with the first argument. Some people may think that students should be given homework so that they can learn what to do. However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a \"teacher\" who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves. In order to avoid this, homework should be abolished so that students can study on their own initiative. Therefore, for these reasons, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that homework makes student passive and it cause students not to think deeply by themselves. However, not all students start to think by themselves without homework. So chance to think or have interest is necessary for them. From that perspective, homework can easily be a trigger to make student think. It is true that some students believe the aim of homework is to submit, but the ability to solve the given problem is also important when they live in society. In addition, in the process of doing homework they can get calculating ability or some useful ability.",
