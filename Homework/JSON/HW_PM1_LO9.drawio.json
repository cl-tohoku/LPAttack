  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". We have two points: The first point is \"free time\" and the second point is \"decrease burden on teachers\". I will explain the first point of \"free time\". We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don't have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that if homework were to be abolished, they could have more free time. As a result, they could do more of what they really wanted. However, time can be spared. We believe if students have time to do club activities or hobbies, they also need to spend some time on homework. We do not oppose club activities or hobbies. However, we believe that as a student, time should be spent on homework. We do not think every student has enough self-discipline. So they are obligated to do homework. We can not always have free time. For their better future, people should do some thing they do not want to.",
