  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that homework should be abolished. We defined that homework for primary students should be abolished. We have two points: First, some students tend to dislike studying. Secondly, we have more effective learning ways than homework. Let me explain our first argument. Some students tend to dislike studying but are obliged to do homework and most of students are not enthusiastic about homework. Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies. They are always looking around, crawling from corner to corner, and touching, even biting, everything unfamiliar to them. In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That's how studying should be. It's not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents. Being obliged will lead to problems between family. That's one of the reasons some students tend to dislike studying. That is why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That's how studying should be. However, it is not always true. Sometimes it is important to learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. However, on the other time, It is also important to refrain what students have learned for their studying. For many people ability of memory is really imperfect, so they will easily forget what they learn after a few days. Furthermore, student are quite immature especially their brain compared with adult. So, it is essential to repeat what they learn so many time. That's why I believe their philosophy of studying is not true.",
