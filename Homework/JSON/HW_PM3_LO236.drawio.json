  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that homework should be abolished. We defined that homework for primary students should be abolished. We have two points: First, some students tend to dislike studying. Secondly, we have more effective learning ways than homework. Let me explain our first argument. Some students tend to dislike studying but are obliged to do homework and most of students are not enthusiastic about homework. Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies. They are always looking around, crawling from corner to corner, and touching, even biting, everything unfamiliar to them. In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That's how studying should be. It's not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents. Being obliged will lead to problems between family. That's one of the reasons some students tend to dislike studying. That is why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that it's not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents, so homework should be abolished. However, it is not true, because more or less students can study thanks to homework. As prime minister said, most students dislike studying. That's why they tend to lose opportunity to learn at home. They often spend time to play game or some hobby. For those students, imposing homework is effective way to familiarize with study itself. Of course it is ideal to study with positive attitude. However, it is difficult to teach the importance of study for all students. Thus homework is important role to spread it. Therefore, homework should not be abolished.",
