  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". We have two points: The first point is \"free time\" and the second point is \"decrease burden on teachers\". I will explain the first point of \"free time\". We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don't have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that students will be able to get more free time. However, it's not always the case. That's because the coach of their club activity is likely to impose longer time to practice than now. Generally speaking they have strong incentive to win the competition. Some try to protect their pride through winning of the club team, Others try to let children feel pleasure through winning the competition. any way they tend to have incentive to impose such long practice time on their students. That characterization is realistic when we look at the reality of Japan, Korea and so on. Hence we say even if homework were abolished, their potential free time could be deprived by the coach. That's the reason why they are less likely to be able to get more free time even if homework were abolished.",
