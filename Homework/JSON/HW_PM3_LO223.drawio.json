  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that homework should be abolished. We defined that homework for primary students should be abolished. We have two points: First, some students tend to dislike studying. Secondly, we have more effective learning ways than homework. Let me explain our first argument. Some students tend to dislike studying but are obliged to do homework and most of students are not enthusiastic about homework. Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies. They are always looking around, crawling from corner to corner, and touching, even biting, everything unfamiliar to them. In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That's how studying should be. It's not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents. Being obliged will lead to problems between family. That's one of the reasons some students tend to dislike studying. That is why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that studying should be like voluntary find the question and research about it and acquire the knowledge as baby do. However, it's doubtful in primary school. Finding new question by themselves are very good and important, but it's not that easy thing which every student can do. We need basic knowledge and skill to research as university students do. It's too difficult to rely only on this studying way to learn all this basic knowledge which we learn in primary school. In primary school we should learn all these basic knowledge and homework helps it.",
