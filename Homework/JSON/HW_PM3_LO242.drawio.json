  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that homework should be abolished. We defined that homework for primary students should be abolished. We have two points: First, some students tend to dislike studying. Secondly, we have more effective learning ways than homework. Let me explain our first argument. Some students tend to dislike studying but are obliged to do homework and most of students are not enthusiastic about homework. Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies. They are always looking around, crawling from corner to corner, and touching, even biting, everything unfamiliar to them. In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That's how studying should be. It's not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents. Being obliged will lead to problems between family. That's one of the reasons some students tend to dislike studying. That is why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that some students tend to dislike studying and forcing homework to children is one of the reasons of it. However, even if whole of it is true, government side hasn't explained why children will like studying or will be able to avoid being forced to study by their teachers or parents by abolishing homework, and we can imagine easily that some students will still be forced to study, because thought of their teachers or parents, hope to put their children into advanced schools will not be changed on government paradigm. Therefore, what Prime Minister said is not the effective reason to abolish homework.",
