  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". We have two points: The first point is \"free time\" and the second point is \"decrease burden on teachers\". I will explain the first point of \"free time\". We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don't have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that if homework were abolished, we could have more time and we could do more of what we really wanted. However, some students who height studying will never study themselves at home. This will lead them to get the bad score in the test. In my case, when teacher gave me homework, I studied hard at home to complete it. Although, in some classes, teacher didn't give me homework, and I have never studied myself to input what I learned in the class. As a result, I got good score in the class which gave me a homework and got bad score in the class which didn't give me a homework.",
