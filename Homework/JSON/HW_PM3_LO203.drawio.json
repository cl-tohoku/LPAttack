  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that homework should be abolished. We defined that homework for primary students should be abolished. We have two points: First, some students tend to dislike studying. Secondly, we have more effective learning ways than homework. Let me explain our first argument. Some students tend to dislike studying but are obliged to do homework and most of students are not enthusiastic about homework. Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies. They are always looking around, crawling from corner to corner, and touching, even biting, everything unfamiliar to them. In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That's how studying should be. It's not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents. Being obliged will lead to problems between family. That's one of the reasons some students tend to dislike studying. That is why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that some students tend to dislike studying. However, yes it might be true somehow. But it is not mutually exclusive in this debate. Even if there are no assignments forced by teacher, children are forced to study every day. For example, no matter how they are not willing to study, they should participate daily classes. If they don't go to school for the sake of hate to study, their parents will force children to go to school and take classes. These oppressive experiences are enough to be dislike studying itself. For this reason, I strongly believe that government point is not a matter.",
