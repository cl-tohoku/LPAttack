  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that homework should be abolished. We strongly support this motion. Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to talk about homework in every school in Japan. We have two points in our argument. The first point is \"harmful efforts\" and the second point is \"decreasing teacher's burden\". Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I'll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study. For all these reasons, we strongly support the motion. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. However, that is extremely rare case. That's because they would be oppressed to modify it by their parents in most cases. We believe that they are likely to be scolded by them because they cannot receive a good score in some exams because of lack of knowledge, which is supposed to be taught through their homework. In that instance it is clear that their parents get angry for that outcome of the exams because they usually want them to get a good score for their future. Hence we say that can work as a strong power to deter them to commit such a bad way to study. That's the reason why we say such case is extremely rare.",
