  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". We have two points: The first point is \"free time\" and the second point is \"decrease burden on teachers\". I will explain the first point of \"free time\". We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don't have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that homework is harmful because it is so big burden for students. . However, it's quite doubtful. This is because their only evidence was the speaker's personal experience. PM's example is quite busy. PM goes to cram school and tennis club every day. We should not assume this logic which based on an extreme example can be applied to every student. In general, homework is not a big burden for most of the students. The teacher gave us homework so that every student will have an absolute minimum level of understanding. If there is such homework that takes so long time, we can just abolish such kind of homework.",
