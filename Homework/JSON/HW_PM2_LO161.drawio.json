  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". I am going to make two arguments: First, forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character, rather than active. Secondly, abolishing assignments can reduce teachers' workloads. Let me start with the first argument. Some people may think that students should be given homework so that they can learn what to do. However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a \"teacher\" who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves. In order to avoid this, homework should be abolished so that students can study on their own initiative. Therefore, for these reasons, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that homework prevents students from being able to think for themselves. However, homework, by its nature, actually requires students to work independently, more so than work done in the classroom. Once the assignment is given by the teacher, it is up to the student to do the work, which entails both preparation and execution. Having to do homework makes students less reliant on their teacher, because they have to figure out how to do the assignment, beyond the basic instructions and guidelines given by the teacher. In addition, teachers can -- and often do -- give creative homework assignments that require independent thinking and develop skills of research, insight and decision-making. Thus, homework is less of an obstacle to independent thinking than a tool that teaches it.",
