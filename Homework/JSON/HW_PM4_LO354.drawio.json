  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that homework should be abolished. We strongly support this motion. Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to talk about homework in every school in Japan. We have two points in our argument. The first point is \"harmful efforts\" and the second point is \"decreasing teacher's burden\". Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I'll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study. For all these reasons, we strongly support the motion. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that in order for students to understand the right and wrong ways to study, homework should be abolished. However, this argument fails to recognize how kids learn any kind of principle: by practice. Kids who are excused from the responsibility of doing homework never get the chance to practice the right and wrong ways to study. It's true that some students will try to cut corners or try to take the easy way out, so to speak, by copying another student's work for instance. But it is a stretch to say that homework is the culprit. Kids are tempted to cut corners and make poor choices in all kinds of situations, and they tend to make all kinds of excuses for their behavior, including not having enough time to do the right thing. In this sense, homework assignments -- with consequences that deter bad choices and reward good ones -- are just one way that kids can learn right from wrong.",
