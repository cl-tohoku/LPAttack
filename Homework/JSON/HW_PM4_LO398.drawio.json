  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that homework should be abolished. We strongly support this motion. Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to talk about homework in every school in Japan. We have two points in our argument. The first point is \"harmful efforts\" and the second point is \"decreasing teacher's burden\". Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I'll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study. For all these reasons, we strongly support the motion. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that students get a passing score if they finish homework even when they copy another's work, so homework should be abolished. However, abolishing homework because some students cheat is unwise because it ends up depriving all students of the academic and other benefits of homework because of the bad choices of some. Moreover, students who cheat by plagiarizing work need to learn a lesson. Simply doing away with homework deprives these students of the chance to learn that lesson and actually rewards them for cheating. In addition, it is a bit naive to think that teachers can't discern when students have copied their work from a classmate or other source. So, students who consistently cheat by copying work are unlikely to get a passing score consistently in reality.",
