  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". I am going to make two arguments: First, forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character, rather than active. Secondly, abolishing assignments can reduce teachers' workloads. Let me start with the first argument. Some people may think that students should be given homework so that they can learn what to do. However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a \"teacher\" who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves. In order to avoid this, homework should be abolished so that students can study on their own initiative. Therefore, for these reasons, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that homework is harmful because school is not a place where students only learn to study. However, it is a stretch to assert that homework does harm because it encourages students to study. While it's true that students should learn life skills as part of their education, this doesn't mean that homework can't help instill those life skills or that studying is detrimental. Both things can be true: homework actually teaches a variety of life skills, and studying to acquire a basic foundation of knowledge is useful for success in the real world. Life skills learned through homework include self-discipline and perseverance, along with the lesson of delayed gratification -- tied to life success -- which kids learn when they put off playing video games until after their homework is done.",
