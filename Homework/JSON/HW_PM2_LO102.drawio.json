  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". I am going to make two arguments: First, forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character, rather than active. Secondly, abolishing assignments can reduce teachers' workloads. Let me start with the first argument. Some people may think that students should be given homework so that they can learn what to do. However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a \"teacher\" who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves. In order to avoid this, homework should be abolished so that students can study on their own initiative. Therefore, for these reasons, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character because they are always being looked after by their teacher. However, there are two rebuttals. First, it is not true because we can manage ourselves even if there are homework. If they think about their academic ability seriously, they can do everything for example read another books, go to cram schools and so on. Therefore homework is not the obstruction of their independence. Second, that is not mutually exclusive. There are no proof that all students will think about themselves seriously. And I think students won't think because most of them think that \"I don't have to study.\" Students are immature, so they will abandon study. Therefore, there are no connection between taking this motion and students independence. And there are no contradiction because first I said about serious students. And second, I said about most of students. Even if some students can think seriously, there are no relationship between homework. As a result, both side their argument is not standing.",
