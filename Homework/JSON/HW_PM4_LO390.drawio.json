  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that homework should be abolished. We strongly support this motion. Before explaining our arguments, let me define the motion. We are going to talk about homework in every school in Japan. We have two points in our argument. The first point is \"harmful efforts\" and the second point is \"decreasing teacher's burden\". Let me explain our first argument. Our claim is that homework has harmful efforts on educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I'll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study. For all these reasons, we strongly support the motion. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that students have a lot of extra activities thus having homework causes them to do that during in class or copy it from other classmates due to a lack of time. However, instead of blaming the amount of homework that the students are doing, why not get down to the real cause? The real reason students are having to do work in class or have to copy is a lack of planning. School should be the most important thing that they focus on. As a young person, school is \"their job\" and should be treated as such, not be treated like an extra thing that they have to do. So if they do not have time to do the homework, then they should cut extra activities or hobbies as needed. There isn't enough time in a day to do everything that you want to do, you have to make things priority and do what is most important first.",
