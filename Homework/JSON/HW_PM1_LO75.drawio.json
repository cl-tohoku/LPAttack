  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". We have two points: The first point is \"free time\" and the second point is \"decrease burden on teachers\". I will explain the first point of \"free time\". We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don't have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that as a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. However, I understand that it is important to have free time to do various hobbies and activities, especially with friends. I'm not arguing that that is not important in someone's life. My argument is that if there is an overwhelming amount of homework, then you may have to change your schedule to be able to have time to do it. If you implement your schedule and set aside a certain amount of time every day to do your homework, you will still have time to do all of your other activities. Homework is not the problem, it's your personal schedule.",
