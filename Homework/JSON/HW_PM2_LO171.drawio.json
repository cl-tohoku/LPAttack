  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". I am going to make two arguments: First, forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character, rather than active. Secondly, abolishing assignments can reduce teachers' workloads. Let me start with the first argument. Some people may think that students should be given homework so that they can learn what to do. However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a \"teacher\" who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves. In order to avoid this, homework should be abolished so that students can study on their own initiative. Therefore, for these reasons, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that homework should be abolished since school is not a place where students only learn to study. However, studying remains a key purpose of school, if not THE key purpose. To say that we should do away with homework because students should be learning how to live instead is a recipe for disaster. We need to prepare students for the real world by giving them a foundation of basic skills. Homework is one way to reinforce these basic skills, including reading, writing and arithmetic. Too often today, we expect schools and teachers to fill roles unrelated to teaching -- expecting teachers to serve as nannies and nurses and counselors, instead of their vital role of passing on knowledge. Homework is still one of the best tools a teacher has to reinforce and extend what is taught in the classroom.",
