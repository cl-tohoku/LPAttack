  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today, we are given the motion that homework should be abolished. We defined that homework for primary students should be abolished. We have two points: First, some students tend to dislike studying. Secondly, we have more effective learning ways than homework. Let me explain our first argument. Some students tend to dislike studying but are obliged to do homework and most of students are not enthusiastic about homework. Studying, in fact, is not something to be obliged but rather for satisfying intellectual curiosity. Imagine one-year old babies. They are always looking around, crawling from corner to corner, and touching, even biting, everything unfamiliar to them. In this way, they learn new things and expand their understanding of the world. That's how studying should be. It's not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents. Being obliged will lead to problems between family. That's one of the reasons some students tend to dislike studying. That is why homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that it's not good for students to be obliged to study by their teachers or parents, so homework should be abolished. . However, when we think of long-term benefit, student get more advantages in homework than abolishing homework because teachers and parents already have experiences through primary school and other social events. If students use that adults' advice and caring, they grow more effectively and efficiently. Primary students are lack of thinking compared with adults, so students should get assistance by teachers and parents as homework. Therefore, it is good for students to be obliged to some extent to study to ensure effective growth.",
