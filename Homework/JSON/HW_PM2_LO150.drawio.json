  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". I am going to make two arguments: First, forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character, rather than active. Secondly, abolishing assignments can reduce teachers' workloads. Let me start with the first argument. Some people may think that students should be given homework so that they can learn what to do. However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a \"teacher\" who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves. In order to avoid this, homework should be abolished so that students can study on their own initiative. Therefore, for these reasons, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that students will start to think about what they need to do by children themselves if homework is abolished. However, the premise of this argument is students can study new things without continuous instructions or guidelines, and it is often not true. For instance, in order to understand about square root, children need to understand about exponentiation, thus teacher required to review it in advance to encourage children to understand well, and there are tons of cases like this, thus continuous instructions or guidelines are needed for children to study or learn something new. Therefore, what Prime Minister said is not the effective reason to abolish homework.",
