  "PM": "Hello everyone. Today's topic is \"Homework should be abolished\". We have two points: The first point is \"free time\" and the second point is \"decrease burden on teachers\". I will explain the first point of \"free time\". We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends. In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don't have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.",
  "LO": "They said that we believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. However, I think homework is very important to the development and growth of children. The most important characteristic of homework is that it reinforces what was learned that day at school. Instead of allowing lessons to be quickly forgotten and left behind it encourages the student to practice those same lessons until the student is at a point where the student feels confident with it. Homework also encourages responsibility because the student has to take responsibility for completing the homework on time and turning it in. If this is not done it will result in a lowering of the student's grade which teaches responsibility. Additionally homework teaches students how to set schedules and prioritize. The student will have to be able to work their assigned homework into available time that may be partially occupied by extra curricular activities. This helps the student to learn to decide what's most important.",
